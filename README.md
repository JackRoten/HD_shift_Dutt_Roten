Created by Baskar Dutt and Jack Roten for UCSB Physics lab course.
UCSB 128AL lab on Hydrogen and Deuterium Isotope Shifts

We observed the Balmer series of Dueterium and Hydrogen to demonstrate the relationship between the mass of the nucleas and the energy spectrum. We capture light from the hydrogen and dueterium gas tube, which travels through a narrow, adjustable, slit. the light is then difracted into its spectrum due to a difraction grating, which is then sent through a secondary narrow slit, to be captured by a Photo Multiplier Tube (PMT)
